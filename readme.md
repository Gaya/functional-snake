#Simple webpack starter kit

Just the basics you need to start using webpack and babel. Nothing fancy, just start already!

Includes:
- webpack
- webpack dev server
- babel with es2015 and stage-2 presets
- eslint (airbnb preset)

How to use:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run serve
```

This will start the webpack-dev-server at [http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/](http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/).

It copies the contents from `assets/` into `dist/` and copies `assets/index.html` to `dist/index.html`. This is your project's entry point.
