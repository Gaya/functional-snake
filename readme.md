#Functional Snake

My little attempt at creating a 'snake' clone from scratch. Using important lessons from functional programming and keeping things pure.

##Running

1. Clone repo

2. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

3. Serve application

```
npm run serve
```

4. Go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) or [http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server](http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server)
